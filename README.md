- Receive an error message when the form is submitted if: the input field is empty

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This project helped me explore API integration, and clipboard interaction among other features. I met with challenges while designing seamless layouts across form factors and there were learnings as I fixed each one of them.


## Setup

Clone this repo to your desktop. Go to its root directory and run `serve`. You will then be able to access it at localhost:8000
